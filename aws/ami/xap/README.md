# XAP/MGT AMI Scripts

The contents of this directory's **subdirectories** are installed into /opt/gigaspaces/scripts on XAP/MGT AMIs. The /opt/gigaspaces directory contains a number of XAP installations. One will be marked current, with a soft-link.

All scripts describe their own behavior in their help output: `./script.sh --help`.
