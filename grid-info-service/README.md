***Purpose:*** This tool connects to a running DataGrid and reports out a variety of data about the grid and its configuration.

***Usage:*** The pom file in this directory prescribes a build that produces an executable jar file with a manifest file that specifies the main-method-containing class. Therefore, instructing the JVM to "run the jar" will have the effect of starting the program.
